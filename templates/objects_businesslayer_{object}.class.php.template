 * Forge Business class

 * {object} is a generated businesslayer class. Any and all database object interaction should pass through this object.
 * It is possible to add custom functions to this file, as once it's generated, it will never be overwritten.
 * This class extends base{object} which extends Forge\BusinessLayer by default.
